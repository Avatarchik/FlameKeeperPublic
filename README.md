# Flame Keeper

A semester long project across two universities and three faculties involving a multidisciplinary team of students tasked with developing a complete game in the Unity3D engine. In game logic and cinematics were scripted via the Unity3D API. Custom lighting and rendering algorithms that ran on the GPU were introduced on top of the existing rendering pipeline to drive the graphical fidelity of the game. Support for mouse and keyboard controls as well as other external peripherals (Xbox controller) is also included.
