# Flame Keeper

A semester long capstone project ran across two universities and three different faculties with the aim of producing a complete game ready for public and media consumption at the annual LevelUp! Show case in Toronto.

This project was built on top of the Unity3D engine with all in game logic, cinematics, and gameplay being scripted through the Unity API in C#. Additional lighting and rendering shaders were written on top Unityâ€™s own scriptable graphics pipeline to further drive the graphical fidelity of the game.
